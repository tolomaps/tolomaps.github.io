<p>In the process of making my &ldquo;<a href="http://tolomaps.com/motherhood" title="Modern Motherhood: A World of Struggle" target="_blank">Modern Motherhood</a>&rdquo; map, I had a vision of what I wanted the graph to look like. But I had no idea how to make it and was overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. At first, I was so intimidated by trying to figure out the end goal that I couldn&rsquo;t even do the first step. </p>
<p>Then, I had a moment. I told myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just one square. That&rsquo;s all you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just needed to draw one square on the page. Then, I could figure out how to attach my data to the squares. Then, I could figure out how to space out the squares so that you could see all of them. Then, how to make them interactive. And so on.</p>
<p>This was a powerful moment. You could even say that it was a bonding moment for JavaScript and me. The great thing about programming is that everything is a problem to be solved. I&rsquo;m a very goal-oriented person, even small goals, so I love this. If you don&rsquo;t know how to solve the problem, break it down into smaller tasks. If those tasks are still too big, break them down even further. Keep breaking them down until you get a problem that you can solve. </p>
<p>Oh, and I asked for help. I got my square on the page, but didn&rsquo;t know what to do next. My friend <a href="http://rashaunamead.com" title="Rashauna Mead" target="_blank">Rashauna</a> sat with me for a couple of hours and helped me think it through. I hope to pay forward that favor to someone else who is learning.</p>
<p>Just one square. That&rsquo;s all you need. Then you go from there.</p>

<p><em>Aw look at my squares, all grown up into rectangles!</em></p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>Fast forward to today: I am working on the <a href="http://tolomaps.tumblr.com/post/104104145998/interactive-cartography-final-project-data" title="Interactive Cartography Final Project" target="_blank">final group project</a> for the same class. I&rsquo;m in charge of making the graph. I have my one square: <img alt="image" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/979a98cd673bf756d05c82c206f68d9e/tumblr_inline_ng6z2z7mcf1sr0q4f.png"/></p>

<p>There it is! That little black square in the upper-right corner of the white rectangle within the blue rectangle. I know it doesn&rsquo;t look like much, but:</p>

<p>It actually has data attached to it. That&rsquo;s not just one square: it&rsquo;s 50 squares that are being drawn, one for each state, one on top of the other. </p>
<p>And now I know that I can make those little squares do whatever I want them to do.</p>
