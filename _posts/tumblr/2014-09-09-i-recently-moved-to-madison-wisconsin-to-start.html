<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nbm7pf7CKp1t0aa2oo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>I recently moved to Madison, Wisconsin, to start grad school in Cartography. I love this city - there are people walking and biking everywhere, we live a few blocks away from the Saturday farmers&rsquo; market and a 10-minute walk from a lovely park by Lake Mendota. But I also recognize that I&rsquo;m in a honeymoon phase, and that I may feel quite differently come winter.</p>
<p>I sent <a href="http://empirenews.net/meteorologists-predict-record-shattering-snowfalls-coming-soon-bread-milk-prices-expected-to-soar/" target="_blank">this article</a> about the intensity of the coming winter to my husband, and here was our conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so screwed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry: &ldquo;Yeah, but at least we aren&rsquo;t on the east coast. Look at the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Maps are deceptive. It&rsquo;s just compared to normal, and normal here is worse than on the east coast.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so I soon found out that <a href="http://thevane.gawker.com/record-shattering-snow-this-winter-take-it-with-a-grai-1631765221" target="_blank">this whole thing was a hoax</a> (which I probably should&rsquo;ve known from the alarmist/sarcastic writing). BUT! As a cartographer, the interesting thing to me here is that he took the map at face value BECAUSE IT&rsquo;S A MAP, and a map is an argument in and of itself. It wasn&rsquo;t active thinking, but rather just looking at the colors and seeing that the words associated with the northeast were bad. Because people think of maps as being objective truth, when really, they&rsquo;re not. Also, I think people have a hard time looking at maps in relative terms - as in, this map doesn&rsquo;t show absolute values of cold or snowfall, but rather a deviation from the norm. And that&rsquo;s pretty complicated to grasp if you&rsquo;re just taking a glance at a map.</p>
<p>Side note: it was an especially genius move to include the &quot;Below Normal Snowfall&rdquo; region of this map, considering pretty much everywhere in that area never has snow. </p>
