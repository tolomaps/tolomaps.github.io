<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mwvkxkNmDB1t0aa2oo1_540.png"/><br/><p>I&rsquo;m always interested to see maps used as marketing material. This map comes from an email from <a href="https://www.uber.com/" title="Uber">Uber</a>, a company that provides private driving services and recently expanded to Bogotá. </p>
<p>The map isn&rsquo;t used for any practical purpose, but its typography and subdued tones match the company&rsquo;s brand. Uber depends on maps for its proper functioning - when a user wants to request a car service, s/he selects their location on the Uber app. <span>Perhaps by visually reminding users that Uber is connected to this city, next time they need to get from one place to another, they will think that this is the best way to get there.</span></p>
<p>Why do companies and organizations use maps for marketing? When did maps become cool (or have they always been)? </p>
