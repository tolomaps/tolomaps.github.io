<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nj4i6iUDNw1t0aa2oo1_1280.png"/><br/><blockquote><a href="http://youarehere.cc/j/subway/WashingtonDC.html">&ldquo;This map visualizes the median household income by station along Washington DC&rsquo;s Metro system&hellip;&rdquo;</a></blockquote><p>I especially love looking at the range of income for each station. Some don&rsquo;t stray too much from their median, whereas others have a huge range of income in the area. </p><p>Interesting design choice to use the actual locations of the stations for the map rather than a typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck">Beck</a>-inspired one. </p>
