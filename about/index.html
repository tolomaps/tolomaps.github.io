      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a map nerd, generalist, feminist, and teacher. I'm straightforward, detail-oriented, and thrive when I have a million things on my plate. I love people.
      </p>
      <p>
        My guiding life principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take calculated risks. What’s the worst that can happen?</li>
        <li>If you don’t ask, you’ll never know.</li>
        <li>Communication is key.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My story: the long version</h3>
      <p>
        Though I'm certainly a map nerd, I’m a generalist who’s quite good at many things but not an expert in any one thing. Unless you can be an expert at asking questions, in which case I am definitely that. I ask the tough questions that everyone is thinking but no one wants to say outloud. I ask targeted questions to help people suss out what they really want or need. I ask questions about why we are doing something a particular way and how we are going to do it. I ask for help when I don’t know how to do something.

      <h3>Things you didn’t ask but now you know</h3>

        <li>I was featured on House Hunters International while living in Bogota, Colombia.</li>
        <li>I will eat ice cream anytime, anywhere.</li>
        <li>Restrepo Leather, a company that I started with my husband, was featured in <a href="http://www.gq.com/gallery/best-stuff-of-the-year-2013#12">GQ’s Best Stuff of 2013</a>.</li>
        <li>My husband and I both changed our last names when we got married.</li>
