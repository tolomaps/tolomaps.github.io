This is the repository for my personal website. My site use to be in WordPress, and I decided to use the opportunity of redoing it to teach myself Jekyll, SASS, and Bootstrap. 

I like keeping my source code open because I referenced other people's code in building my own site. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about how I built my site.
