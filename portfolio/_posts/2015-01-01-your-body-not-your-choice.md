**About:**
This [interactive map and full-featured website](http://yourbodynotyourchoice.github.io){:target="blank"} covers the history of state-level abortion policy in the United States from the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 through 2014. I worked together with [Katie Kowalsky](http://katiekowalsky.me/){:target="blank"} and [Dylan Moriarty](http://dylanmoriarty.github.io){:target="blank"} to collect the data, create the interactive map and chart in D3, write content, and code the website.

Your Body, (Not) Your Choice was featured on the [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/2015/03/18/abortion-policies-over-time-and-by-state/){:target="blank"} blog (the nerd highlight of my life!) and won Honorable Mention for the [CaGIS 2014 Map Competition](http://www.cartogis.org/awards/winners2014.php){:target="blank"}.

**Process:**
Read [my blog posts about the process](http://tolomaps.tumblr.com/tagged/yourbodynotyourchoice){:target="blank"}.
Katie also [wrote a few blog posts on the process](https://kowalskycartography.wordpress.com/tag/575-final-project/){:target="blank"}.
