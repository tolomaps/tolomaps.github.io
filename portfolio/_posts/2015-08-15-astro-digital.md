Astro Digital was the main client that I worked with while doing a 2015 summer fellowship at [Development Seed](http://www.developmentseed.org). Itâ€™s a start-up that lets you easily search and publish satellite imagery through their [imagery browser](https://fetch.astrodigital.com/). My main role on the project was working on the user profile accounts, where you can store all of your published maps in one place and set alerts to let you know when new imagery is available in areas that you want to track.

I led the discussion on how to direct users through the website and create a cohesive experience. When I came on the project, there was no connection between the imagery browser and the user profile, which were built as two separate applications. The two platforms looked and felt detached from each other. I created wireframes for how the site should flow from one platform to the other to create a seamless experience. This also included figuring out how users should create accounts and log in.

The imagery browser originally had the interactive map on the left-hand side of the page, with the available imagery on the right-hand side. It also had the filter buttons on the top menu bar.
