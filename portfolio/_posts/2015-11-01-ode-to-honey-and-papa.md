**About:**
I made this map in memory of my maternal grandparents, Carol and Van Hart, fondly known as Honey and Papa. My parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings helped me compile a list of places that were meaningful to Honey and Papa.

**Process:**
The colors for the map came from [the stained glass](https://www.instagram.com/p/yxILddEUfI/?tagged=montgomerytour){:target="blank"} at the old train station in Montgomery, Alabama, where my grandparents were from. The inspiration to create the map came after a visit to Montgomery for Honey's funeral, and driving around to see all of the important places in her life (and my childhood).

I created all of the textures in Photoshop, the texture of each color distinct from the rest. I created the map in Mapbox Studio Classic with custom CartoCSS.
