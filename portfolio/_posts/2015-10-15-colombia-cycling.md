**About:**
The assignment for this class project was to create a map for a cycling competition for anywhere in the world and display it on a shaded relief terrain map. Naturally, I chose Colombia as the site for my fake competition, considering I lived there for several years and Colombia is well-known for its high-caliber cyclists. I created a totally unrealistic and ridiculous route, taking cyclists through known dangerous areas, up and down the Andes Mountains numerous times. Because why not?

**Process:**
I created the shaded relief in Blender, thanks to [Daniel Huffman's excellent tutorial](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/blender-tutorial/){:target="blank"}. After I got the hang of it, I loved working with Blender and think that it produces much more realistic shaded relief than the default methods that are often used.
