title: Data management is the problem that programming is supposed to solve. But of
  course now that we have computers everywhere, we keep generating more data, which
  requires more programming, and so forth. It’s a hell of a problem with no end in
  sight. This is why people in technology make so much money. Not only do they sell
  infinitely reproducible nothings, but they sell so many of them that they actually
  have to come up with new categories of infinitely reproducible nothings just to
  handle what happened with the last batch. That’s how we ended up with ‘big data.’
  I’ve been to big-data conferences and they are packed.
