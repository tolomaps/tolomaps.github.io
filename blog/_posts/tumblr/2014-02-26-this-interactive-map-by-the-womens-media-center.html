You can click on the locations and read reports about soldiers being forced to rape women and men or about women being used as human shields, among all sorts of other terrible things. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Women&rsquo;s Media Center initiative, WMC&rsquo;s Women Under Siege is documenting and advocating against sexualized violence in conflict. Spearheaded by Gloria Steinem, this initiative explores historical evidence that sexualized violence occurred in wars from the Holocaust to the present day. In the belief that understanding what happened in the past might have helped us to prevent or to prepare for the mass sexual assaults of other conflicts, from Bosnia to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WMC&rsquo;s Women Under Siege is working to heighten public consciousness of causes and preventions.</p>

<p>As a Jew who has always believed in the concept of <em>tikkun olam</em> - the idea that the world is broken and it is our job as humans to fix it - I often wonder how much maps can actually help towards this goal of repairing the world. There are days when I believe - if only people were informed! Then things would be better! And maps can help educate people about the awful things we need to change!</p>
<p>But then I see a map like this and think: I am so helpless. What can I do to help prevent rape in Syria? The WMC&rsquo;s goal of heightening public consciousness of causes and preventions is noble, but what are those preventions we can actually implement? The WMC says that the map &ldquo;<span>can be used to aid the international community in grasping the urgency of what is happening in Syria, and can provide the base for potential future prosecutions.&rdquo; But what can be done now? What does it matter if we find people guilty </span><span>of committing terrible acts of sexual violence </span><span>in the future if there is nothing we can do in the present to stop it from happening in the first place? And this map doesn&rsquo;t even show all of the instances of sexual violence, just the ones that have been reported, surely it is much worse than what is depicted here&hellip;</span></p>
<p>On days like today, I am cynical of the utility of consciousness-raising. Can maps actually make a difference? Does raising awareness and educating people actually help bring about change? What does that change look like? <span>What do you think?</span><span> </span></p>
