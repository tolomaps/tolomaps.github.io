<a href="http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/19/why-we-think-of-north-pointing-up/">Why we think of north pointing up</a><br/><p>As a geographer, it is one of my pet peeves when people say that Canada is &ldquo;above&rdquo; the U.S. or that Asia is &ldquo;to the right&rdquo; of Europe. A lot of people don&rsquo;t recognize that those positions are relative because we think of north as up. It&rsquo;s a losing battle though.Â </p>
