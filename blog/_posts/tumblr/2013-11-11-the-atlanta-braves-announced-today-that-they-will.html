<p>This map is absolutely brilliant. It uses the team&rsquo;s patriotic colors to show a map of greater Atlanta, with each dot representing a ticket sold to a Braves game in 2012. It also highlights where Turner Field, the current stadium, sits as well as the NEW STADIUM (all in CAPS for additional emphasis). So most people will see this map and think, &ldquo;Wow, yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Now people won&rsquo;t have to travel as far to cheer on our boys.&quot; </p>
<p>But, really, this map shows us pretty much nothing. There is no additional analysis on how long it will take for fans to get to the new stadium due to lack of public transportation in the new location and already high traffic at the intersection of I-75 and I-285. The team states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for moving is simple. The current location has certain issues that are insurmountable and will only become more problematic over the years. These fundamental issues involve how you, our fans, access Turner Field. There is a lack of consistent mass transportation, a lack of sufficient parking and a lack of direct access to interstates. Furthermore, the Braves do not have control over the development of our immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>Our new location will give us the opportunity to develop the surrounding area of the new ballpark, transforming it into a mixed use, 365-day destination and creating an enhanced atmosphere for our fans during Braves games. There also will be significantly increased access to the site, enhanced parking opportunities, and, generally, easier access to and from major roadways with a variety of other transportation options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their description of why the new location is better doesn&rsquo;t actually address the issue of a lack of consistent mass transportation. Ok, so there will be more parking and closer access to interstates, but does that translate to less time sitting in your car going to/from the baseball game? They don&rsquo;t say how they plan to address the ridiculous traffic that already exists at this intersection. </p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised. It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that Atlanta&rsquo;s flagship newspaper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, moved its headquarters to the suburbs. </p>
