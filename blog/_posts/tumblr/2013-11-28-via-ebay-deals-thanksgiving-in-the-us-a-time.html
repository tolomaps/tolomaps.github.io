<p>Thanksgiving in the U.S. - a time for turkey, being with loved ones, and&hellip; maps. Ebay did a survey of 15,000 people to ask about their Thanksgiving traditions and mapped out how the answers varied across the country.Â </p>
<p>Of course I love the idea of mapping regional differences on any topic, and I love when unconventional sources are putting maps out into the world. But I couldn&rsquo;t help but cringe when I saw this map, thinking, &ldquo;Why is that the color scale?&rdquo; (it has some other cartographic issues too, but let&rsquo;s just stick to colors for today) For a sequential dataset, why use a rainbow color scheme? And does the color blue even show up anywhere on this map? This data would be so much easier to interpret with a color palette that went from light to dark, where dark equals more booze. Clearly it is essential that I know where in the country people drink more on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>In Ebay&rsquo;s defense, they did <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxJAiKTUTntSR3JQTUtvMmhsTGs/edit?usp=sharing" title="Ebay Thanksgiving data">publish their data</a> if you feel like playing around with it yourself. And they asked a whole bunch of other questions, so check out <a href="http://deals.ebay.com/blog/thanksgiving-traditions/" title="Thanksgiving traditions">their post</a> to see more mediocre maps.</p>
