At first glance, it seems like a fairly straightforward proportional symbols map with a timeline, but what I love about it is the endless potential for exploration. Not only can you interact with the data temporally, but you can also click on individual countries to get more information about where, exactly, refugees went in a given year. There are also stories for each year that give additional background information for select places. I am thoroughly impressed with the aesthetics as well as the interactivity of the map. The creators took an extremely complex dataset and created something quite compelling. I can&rsquo;t stop looking at it.</p>
