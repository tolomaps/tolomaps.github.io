<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mwn7cnJLl91t0aa2oo1_1280.gif"/><br/><p>I can&rsquo;t stop watching <a href="http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/11/amazing-1880-statistical-atlas-and-some.html">this GIF</a> of proportions of occupations of various economic sectors from the 1880 census. The jump from service jobs to agricultural jobs is astounding. Would love to see this same style applied to the jobs of today.Â </p>
<p>Check out this GIF and other goodies that John Nelson from IDV Solutions found in Scribner&rsquo;s Statistical Atlas of the United States <a href="http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/11/amazing-1880-statistical-atlas-and-some.html" title="Scribner's Statistical Atlas of the United States">here</a>.</p>
