<a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/women-now-empowered-by-everything-a-woman-does,1398/">Women Now Empowered By Everything A Woman Does</a><br/><p>The Onion nails it. 10 years old, but still so true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>&ldquo;Unlike traditional, phallocentric energy bars, whose chocolate, soy protein, nuts, and granola ignored the special health and nutritional needs of women, their new, female-oriented counterparts like Luna are ideally balanced with a more suitable amount of chocolate, soy protein, nuts, and granola,&rdquo; Klein said. &ldquo;Proto-feminist pioneers like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony could never have imagined that female empowerment would one day come in bar form.&rdquo;</span></p>
