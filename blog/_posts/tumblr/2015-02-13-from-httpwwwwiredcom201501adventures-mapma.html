What&rsquo;s fascinating is the data that it&rsquo;s showing. Mason Inman, the journalist who created it, opens his piece like this:</p><blockquote>US oil production has been booming the past few years, due in large part to North Dakota’s Bakken formation, a rock layer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qKadxyMOYY">tapped through fracking</a>. Each well travels down about two miles, then turns horizontally and snakes through the rock formation for another two miles. There were 8,406 of these Bakken wells, as of <a href="https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/directorscut/directorscut-2014-12-12.pdf">North Dakota’s latest count</a>. If you lined them all up—including their vertical and horizontal parts—they’d loop all the way around the Earth.</blockquote><p>I love the thought of mapping what is below the Earth&rsquo;s surface, what is physically there and impacting our planet, yet invisible to us. </p>
