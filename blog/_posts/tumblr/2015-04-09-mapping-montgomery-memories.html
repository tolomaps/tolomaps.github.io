<p>My grandma passed away in February. We all called her Honey, which just fit her so perfectly. I can still hear her sweet Southern drawl saying, &ldquo;Well hello, dahlin!&quot; </p><p>She lived most of her life in Montgomery, Alabama, and that is where we went to bury her. It was such a familiar yet strange feeling being back there, knowing that I would probably never go back. Along with my sister and parents, we did one last tour of the city, visiting all of the special spots, each weighted with its own version of nostalgia. </p><p>One of these spots was the old train station, where my mom and uncle recounted going to pick up their dad when he got home from business trips. The railroad is still there, but the old train station is now a museum, offices, and a parking lot. They left the old stained glass, though. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2592" data-orig-width="1944"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/2c69502ab2fd912696b4b098c72f46e2/tumblr_inline_nmiwo1jBEx1sr0q4f_540.jpg" data-orig-height="2592" data-orig-width="1944"/></figure><p>My sister, who does printmaking as a hobby, commented that she loved the colors and wanted to incorporate them into some future print. Naturally, I thought of making a map to commemorate our final visit to this city.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had the thought rolling around in my head since that day, but today I found myself with some time on my hands and decided to start on it. First I gathered up the colors.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="499" data-orig-width="612"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/a3bc1b1e8a0e4db8145105ae3fb61bf0/tumblr_inline_nmiwwkGA0Z1sr0q4f_540.png" data-orig-height="499" data-orig-width="612"/></figure><p>My ultimate plan is to make an interactive map that incorporates <a href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/montgomerytour/">photos from that trip</a>. This is just the start. More to come.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2876" data-orig-width="2411"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/2ff212c265c8bbd48fe5344db25a222d/tumblr_inline_nmiwcxseQx1sr0q4f_540.png" data-orig-height="2876" data-orig-width="2411"/></figure>
