<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_my813tLYnL1t0aa2oo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>It&rsquo;s public knowledge that the U.S. has been giving billions of dollars a year to the Colombian government through Plan Colombia since the end of the Clinton administration. However, the Washington Post came out today with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/12/21/covert-action-in-colombia/" title="Covert Action in Colombia">an investigative piece</a> that brings to light direct involvement of the U.S. in providing assistance with precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The U.S. government has been giving intelligence and direct guidance regarding the targeted killings of FARC and ELN leaders using GPS-directed bombs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some senior officials worried that Colombian forces might use the PGMs to kill their perceived political enemies. “The concerns were huge given their human rights problems,” said a former senior military officer.</p>
<p>To assure themselves that the Colombians would not misuse the bombs, U.S. officials came up with a novel solution. The CIA would maintain control over the encryption key inserted into the bomb, which unscrambled communications with GPS satellites so they can be read by the bomb’s computers. The bomb could not hit its target without the key. The Colombians would have to ask for approval for some targets, and if they misused the bombs, the CIA could deny GPS reception for future use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, now time to discuss the map. I&rsquo;m quite disappointed by it, as the cartographer, <a href="http://www.mapmanusa.com/" title="Gene Thorp">Gene Thorp</a>, tends to produce well-designed journalism maps. Here are my main gripes:</p>
<ol><li><span>What is this weird projection and angle used to look at a map of Colombia? Why is so much of the map totally irrelevant information? It unnecessarily skews the country and makes the map much harder to interpret than if it used a more straightforward projection. </span></li>
<li><span>Why aren&rsquo;t the yellow, red, and blue areas explained in the legend? </span></li>
</ol><p><span>As for #1, I can relate to the conundrum that the map designer faced here. Computer screens are landscape-oriented. Colombia is portrait-oriented. I can just imagine his editor said, &ldquo;I need a horizontal map of Colombia.&rdquo; But I have yet to see a map of Colombia in a landscape orientation that actually looks good. I know there is no easy solution and </span><span>all maps are inaccurate in their own way, but what was the cartographer thinking when he made this particular choice? </span><span>There is also quite a bit of cartographic noise on this map due to the projection and angle. Why do I need to see that the capital of Costa Rica is San Jose? Why is Costa Rica even on this map? </span></p>
<p>As for #2, it took me a little while to figure out what the yellow areas were on the map, even though they take up quite a bit of the area of Colombia. I can think of no reason that the yellow, red, and blue areas are pointed out on the map rather than in the legend. It would make more sense to point out specific places on the map like, &ldquo;Airstrike that killed Raúl Reyes,&rdquo; or give some additional information that makes more sense in the context of the exact location on the map.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of redeeming qualities of this map, but keep getting distracted by the terrible projection and angle. Let me know if you have any other observations.</p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m not a fan of the map, the article is excellent.</p>
<p>Side note: as an American expat living in Colombia, this line just made me crack up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“We learned from the CIA,” a top Colombian national security official said of the debriefing program. “Before, we didn’t pay much attention to details.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Edit a couple of hours after the original post:</em></p>
<p>A friend pointed out to me that if you are looking at the piece on a smaller browser window, the map adjusts accordingly. At its smallest size (for a mobile device), it deals with my main issues. But why can&rsquo;t it be well-designed for computer screens too? </p>
