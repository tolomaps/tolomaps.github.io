    <p><em>This is <a href="http://tolomaps.tumblr.com/tagged/yourbodynotyourchoice" title="Your Body, (Not) Your Choice posts" target="_blank">part of a series</a> to document the process of completing a group final project for the Interactive Cartography &amp; Geovisualization class that I took in Fall 2014. </em></p>
<p>In our project to map the history of abortion policy in the United States since Roe v. Wade, we also wanted to include data on our map about abortion providers today. Where are they located? In our search for similar attempts, we came across <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/22/interactive-map-america-s-abortion-clinics.html" title="The Geography of Abortion Access" target="_blank">this interactive map by The Daily Beast</a>: </p>
<p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/120b81ce9fc2bc474e60a2d7979237eb/tumblr_inline_ni3lc9s9HH1sr0q4f.png"/></p>
<p>And recently, I came across <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/7/texas-abortion-clinicshowfaristoofartodrive.html" title="Texas abortion clinics" target="_blank">this map by Aljazeera America of the closing of abortion clinics in Texas</a> due to restrictive laws: <img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/5833da234bdabe05640b1d470eaf9b4e/tumblr_inline_ni3lfv4Hkf1sr0q4f.png"/></p>
<p>Both of these are legitimate attempts to show that abortion access is restricted for many women outside of major metropolitan areas in the United States. However, the danger in these maps is that they don&rsquo;t even show the full extent of restricted access. Both maps calculate the &ldquo;distance to the nearest abortion clinic&rdquo; as the user hovers over the map. However, this distance is calculated <em>as the crow flies</em>, not actually showing the number of miles it would take a woman to travel to get to the nearest clinic. </p>
<p>We knew that with a topic as sensitive as abortion, we needed to be careful about the kind of information that we included and what it might imply. Ultimately, we decided not to include distance information on our map, as it would be misleading. If a woman theoretically has to travel 90 miles to get to the nearest abortion provider, in reality it is more than that, depending on where she lives and how direct the roads are. In a perfect world, I would&rsquo;ve loved to include actual travel distances on our map, but alas, it was outside the scope of this project.</p>
<p>The project is finished, but is still being touched up before we make it public. Coming soon! </p>
