<blockquote>
<p>Learn to make a map before learning to make a <em>good</em> map. If you don’t start with the how, you’re going to struggle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andy,</p>
<p>First, a little background on who I am and where I&rsquo;m coming from:</p>
<p>I studied geography in college and loved my cartography classes, but had no idea where to take it from there. A few years later, I talked my way into a job, starting up a <a href="http://ceelat.org/mapas/" title="CEELAT Mapping Lab" target="_blank">Mapping Lab</a> at a non-profit in Colombia. I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing, but I wanted to learn how to make online interactive maps, and somehow I convinced someone else to pay me while I did it.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, but only made it so far. It turns out that it's <em>hard</em> to learn how to code, especially on your own. I was trying to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, and CartoCSS, armed with one beginning programming class under my belt (which turned out to be one of the most useful classes I ever took). I was fighting the <em>how</em> so much, that I couldn&rsquo;t even get to the cartographic design part. After struggling on my own for a couple of years, I decided to apply to grad school so I could learn from and alongside others. </p>
<p>So, here I am now, both a student and teacher of cartography. You bemoan the current setup in academic cartography, where you&rsquo;re learning cartographic principles in lecture, and ostensibly learning the <em>how</em> of making maps in lab.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the usual result is an awkward lecture/lab split in which students receive barely enough technical instruction to make a map, never mind actually realizing most of the concepts they learn in lecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I deal with this tension on a daily basis. On the one hand, I wish the TA in my interactive cartography class could sit next to me while I learn to code, so I can ask questions as they come up. What&rsquo;s a method? How do I know if this is jQuery or Leaflet? Why is this code not making my map change the way that I wanted it to? How do I conceptualize solving this problem? I can&rsquo;t interpret whatever the API reference is trying to tell me, can you help?</p>
<p>On the other hand, as a Teaching Assistant in the intro to cartography class, I know that it&rsquo;s impossible for me to hold someone&rsquo;s hand as they work through making a map and telling them everything they need to know. I can show them the basics of ArcMap and Illustrator, but other than that, it&rsquo;s better for me to go around during lab and assist students as they come across issues or help think about why they want to show something a certain way. But I can&rsquo;t be there at 2:00am when they&rsquo;ve been banging their head against a wall for a couple of hours out of frustration at a software.</p>
<p>Thus I know that my TA can&rsquo;t hold my hand either, and that I&rsquo;m just going to have to struggle through it. So, it&rsquo;s quite easy to say something like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make room in a curriculum to teach the technology right. When it’s done well, technical skills are extensible, not just an exercise in button-pushing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do you actually implement that? How do you actually teach the technology without sitting there, being able to answer every question as it comes up? How do you do that when someone isn&rsquo;t quite at the level to be able to take advantage of online forums and resources, which usually assume a base level of knowledge that they don&rsquo;t yet have?</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve started doing in the labs that I teach is to be honest with the students when they ask me a question that I don&rsquo;t know how to answer. I say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember how to do that in Illustrator, let&rsquo;s look it up together. The pen tool can be confusing.&rdquo; So much of learning is having the persistence to look things up on your own until you find the right answer, or asking the person next to you for help, or just messing around with it. And even then, you still won&rsquo;t get it a lot of the time, but you&rsquo;ll probably have learned something else in the process. I want to show them that it&rsquo;s ok to not know the answer, and that you&rsquo;ll probably never fully understand every capability that a given software has. </p>
<p>So, how do we learn the how? And how do we teach it? </p>
<p>Saludos,<br/>Robin</p>
<p>P.S. I have more thoughts related to Denis Wood&rsquo;s rant against academic cartography, but that will have to wait for another day.</p>
