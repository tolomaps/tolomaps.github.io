  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I&rsquo;m currently running for the board for <a href="http://openstreetmap.us/" title="OpenStreetMap US" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap U.S.</a>, an organization dedicated to promoting OSM. It&rsquo;s an organization that I have been wanting to get more involved with, and serving on the board would be a great way for me to give back.</p>
<p>My position &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/robin27/diary/23928" title="Robin Tolochko OSM U.S. Board Manifesto" target="_blank">here</a>, but I also sent an email to the talk-us listserv in response to a debate about whether number of OSM edits should be a determing factor in whether or not someone is qualified to serve on the board. I&rsquo;m pasting the text here, because it&rsquo;s really my manifesto pt. 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="gmail_extra">I considered not running for the board because of the low number of edits that I&rsquo;ve done, but ultimately decided that I have a lot to contribute to OSM in other ways. It is anyone&rsquo;s prerogative to not vote for someone while taking edits into account, but I want to explain why I decided to run despite my low number of edits.</div>
<br/><div class="gmail_extra"></div>
<div class="gmail_extra">I recently moved back to the U.S. after living in Bogota, Colombia, for the last four years. While living there, I used OSM data regularly in my job as a cartographer at an NGO and ran OSM workshops for local university students. I just moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where I am starting up a <a href="http://maptime.io/about" target="_blank">Maptime</a> chapter and plan to do an introduction to OSM as our first session. I have been wanting to get more involved with OSM, and I realized that I could put my community outreach and organizing to use by running for the board.</div>
<br/><div class="gmail_extra"></div>
<div class="gmail_extra">As I and many other nominees stated, it&rsquo;s important to get new people involved. But editing OSM can be quite intimidating to a new person, and I would make it a priority to improve the on-ramp. I also think that we should take advantage of existing learning networks, like universities, to spread awareness of OSM and recruit more contributors. I know that these are ambitious goals, and they may take more than a year, but those would be my priorities on the board.</div>
<br/><div class="gmail_extra"></div>
<div class="gmail_extra">I don&rsquo;t think it would be wise for the OSM U.S. board to be comprised entirely of inexperienced mappers, but I think it could benefit from having someone on board who brings a fresh perspective and could even be considered an &ldquo;outsider.&rdquo; The future success of OSM, after all, depends on bringing more outsiders into the fold. Also, I did not make the decision to run for board lightly. I recognize that it would be a serious time and energy commitment, but serving on the board would take advantage of my strengths to give back to an organization that I deeply believe in.</div>
<div class="gmail_extra"></div>
<br/><div class="gmail_extra">I&rsquo;m happy to talk with anyone, so please feel free to reach out to me via email or <a href="https://twitter.com/tolomaps" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. </div>
<div class="gmail_extra"></div>
<br/><div class="gmail_extra">Saludos,</div>
